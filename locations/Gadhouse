And here again the wall banging began, girl bed on the floor, but here again knocking. All got scared and in the center of the room gathered, all sitting to each other cuddling. But here it is in one wall knock, the other.At four o`clock, the Blizzard stopped, and the snow was, and he ceased to go, in the window was visible.
So until six in the morning pounded. And in seven parents came. All children, parents told, and they don`t believe. Children ran out into the street, and around the house no trace in the snow no.

She decided to read a book, took the book, turns, and behind the glass her husband is. It is like a glass door in it will start, he was hit on the head door, he looked at her and walked away. Then her other friend told, and she advised her animals what ever to have, the cat or dog. She brought the dog. Back again from work, comes into the room, and he lies on the sofa.

The man with the sled jumped and rushed to run towards the village, right through the snow and ran, until head to Church, what it`s worth, not crashed.

I get a figure of the male profile, his nose was straight and aquiline. This profile was holding, that-some sort of bouquet of flowers. A friend of my got an abstract figure, similar to kettle. And her school friend â€“ the image of an infant. Decided to fix again, burn the paper and watch the shadows on the wall. This time I clearly drew a large steamer. My friend â€“ nothing special, but the third girl`s baby again, only with a stroller. The school friend was not married and the children she never had. All, he sat and began to disperse. To me at that time was to drive up my young man. I went down, and he came out of the car and pulls out a beautiful bouquet of roses for me. The reason was not any, he just wanted to please me. I was surprised, because I remembered at once the profile of a man on the wax with a bouquet of flowers. But after 4 months I met another man, your grandfather, which was released and then married. And he, as you know, really has a straight nose with a small hump.  It turns out, the flowers gave me one, and I got married to another... But the most interesting thing from this high school friend â€“ she really had a baby at the end of the year, when we wondered. So do not believe these fortune-telling...'

Reaching the glade, we dispersed to their cherished places and silently gathered berries. I dostalsya plot around a huge stump, round which grew a dense Bush. Here I saw a very large number of ripe strawberry. I squatted and, rejoicing, I will gather more, than my brothers, slowly collect the berries and put it in a glass, tied at the waist. Suddenly I heard what-noise. I turn on the sound, but again silently. Place is dead, I don`t see anybody. I once again gather berries. This was repeated several times. And suddenly... I see on the stump, through the Bush, on the haunches of a seated man. His hands parted the bushes and looked at me. I was scared. I ran screaming and crying to the brothers. They tried to stop me, calm, but I continued with my running. The brothers ran after me, and behind us ran the man. Suddenly the elder brother shouted: «Run on team*!». As a team we have a Central collective farm was called, - explains to you grandma. - She was very close to the forest. When we ran out of the woods, this man was not following us. Resorting to the brigade, the brothers told this to the foreman. He immediately grabbed the phone and began where-it is possible to call. And we were reassured farmers. Few come to himself, we went home. At home mom us fed, watered and comforted.
The next day we were informed, near the station Ratomka were dismantled railroad rails.
Apparently it was the man, who ran for us. The fact, in the pre-war years we were infiltrated by spies, saboteurs, who led subversive activities, and pronanut was easy, as the territory is covered by forests, stretching to the borders.
This fear, this horror, I experienced then, in children, even pre-school age, fuse my soul so, I nezabudu it for the rest of my life...'
