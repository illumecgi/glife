I miscalculated something, for example due to sharp hormonal change you have bad acme on your face and I failed to change your eyes and lips. On the bright side, your body will change much faster than the one of a natural born woman. That means it will be easy to gain and lose weight and change facial features. All in all you turned quite well. By the way, your new ''equipment'' down there is fully functional, so if you don''t want to be a mommy, you should think about using contraceptives."'

	'"Well, yes. I won''t argue about that." Karin agrees. "It''s your life and you decide what you do with it, but for the time being, you cannot go back to your old life, so deal with it. On a side note, I already took care of an alibi. Today Michael crashed his car into the pit and died, it''s on the news." With these words, Karin picked up the remote and turned on the TV.'

The body that ''died'' behind the wheel of the BMW was a perfect copy of your old self, from your absorbed amulet energy down to the placement of every single hair."' 
		'"Anyways, here are your new legal documents, including a new passport. Starting today, you are <<$name>> <<$surname>>, 18 years old, female and live in the city. Nobody knows you, but you at least have an apartment to call home. This is a gift to you from Juugo. Here are the keys to it. Now get up, you''ve got to go to your new home and start a new life."'

			'You look at him. "Forget it. Listen Juugo... what do I do now?"'
			'Juugo nods and says, "Well, I would advise you to start by buying food, all sorts of washing powders, laundry detergents and dishes. There are very few supplies already in the apartment, but they''ll only last you a day or two. There''s no TV either. Then get a job. Not far from your new home is a small café, if I remember correctly there was a vacant waitress position not too long ago. You should talk to the owner of the café about the job. Don''t forget to monitor your health, keep your mood up and have a clear mind."'
			'"Now your mind is very weak, if you don''t take care of yourself you will go crazy. You need to eat well, sleep regularly, have fun, do not generally become depressive or else you end up in a madhouse. Don''t go looking for Karin, you will not find her anyway, and secondly, if we need to contact you, we will find you."'
			'You arrived at some five-story Khrushchev era buildings. Juugo stopped the car and pointed a finger at the entrance. "Your apartment number 69, Karin already gave you the key. Now go. Remember don''t just give up, not everyone gets an entirely new chance at life. Karin and me will keep an eye out for you."'
